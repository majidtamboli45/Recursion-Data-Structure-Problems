# Recursion-Data-Structure-Problems
Here I solved the problems of Recursion Tree Problems

Here’s a clear, simple description you can use:

A **recursive data structure** is a data structure that is defined in terms of **smaller instances of the same data structure**. In other words, a recursive data structure contains elements that are themselves of the same type as the overall structure.

It typically has:

* **Base case(s)**: the simplest form of the structure that does not contain a smaller instance (prevents infinite recursion)
* **Recursive case(s)**: one or more references to the same data structure type

Common examples include:

* **Linked lists**, where each node points to another linked list
* **Trees**, where each node contains child nodes that are also trees
* **Graphs**, where nodes may reference other nodes of the same type

Recursive data structures are especially useful for representing **hierarchical or nested data**, and they are often processed using **recursive algorithms** that naturally follow the structure’s definition.

If you want it **shorter**, **more formal**, or with **code examples**, tell me the context (exam, assignment, documentation, etc.).
